And that&#8217;s why so many people are being infected.&nbsp; Our bodies haven&#8217;t built up an immunity to it like we have with the cold virus, and therefore we are more at risk of contracting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the virus has been causing the most deaths among people with underlying health conditions.&nbsp; It affects the lungs and airways so people with conditions like asthma and breathing problems can be worst affected.&nbsp; People with lower immune systems such as diabetics are also at a higher risk of catching it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the symptoms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The symptoms of the illness are very similar to those of the common cold, and this makes it harder for people to realise they have it \u2013 or to worry they do when they don\u2019t.&nbsp; The symptoms are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Coughing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A high temperature<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shortness of breath<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.exactclean.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Bacteria-and-Virus.jpg\" alt=\"COVID-19 Coronavirus\" class=\"wp-image-2533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.exactclean.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Bacteria-and-Virus.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.exactclean.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Bacteria-and-Virus-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bacteria virus cell macro. 3D render background<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Catching coronavirus<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The government isn&#8217;t sure how it passes from one person to another, but the most common belief is that it spreads through cough droplets.&nbsp; If someone coughs without a tissue in front of their mouth, tiny droplets of spit containing the virus can be thrown into the air \u2013 and land on different surfaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The virus is also believed to live on surfaces such as worktops and door handles for up to 72 hours.&nbsp; This is why the government&#8217;s advice is critical:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use a hand sanitiser gel if there&#8217;s no soap<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when coughing or sneezing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Put used tissues straight into the bin then wash your hands<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you may have come into contact with someone who has the virus and may have it yourself, don&#8217;t go to the doctor&#8217;s surgery or hospital.&nbsp; Instead, call 111, and they will get you the help you need as well as ensuring you don&#8217;t spread the virus to anyone else.&nbsp; Testing is done, and you will know quickly if you have the virus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to combat coronavirus<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the government&#8217;s advice is the first step in protecting yourself from COVID-19.
