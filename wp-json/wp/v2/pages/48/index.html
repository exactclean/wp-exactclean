Carpets should be cleaned on a regular basis, before they become heavily soiled. Allowing soil to build up will significantly reduce the life of a carpet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will my carpets re-soil more quickly following cleaning?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today&#8217;s chemicals and detergents are manufactured to the highest specifications for quality and effectiveness. At Exact Clean we only use detergents designed for the removal of soil from carpets and upholstery. When used correctly, these will not lead to any rapid re-soiling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Detergents that are not designed for use on carpets and upholstery may cause re-soiling problems. Wherever possible, we will use Eco-Friendly cleaning solutions, formulated from renewable resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will children\/pets be affected by cleaning processes\/chemicals?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We take the health and safety of our clients seriously. All our cleaning solutions are tested for their effects on the environment and occupants of areas in which they will be used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We ensure that the relevant safety procedures are followed during the cleaning process. We strongly recommend that children and pets stay off of a damp carpet until it is completely dry, this will help prevent slip and fall hazards as well as tracking in fresh soil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How long will my carpet or furniture take to dry?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Drying time depends on many factors &#8211; how soiled the item was, how much water was used, weather conditions, indoor atmosphere. However, in most cases, carpets and soft furnishings should be dry within 10-12 hours. At Exact Clean we use specialist tools to speed up the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will all the stains come out?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t guarantee to remove every stain. Unfortunately, some permanently damage the carpet fibres and no amount of specialist cleaning will reverse this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do I have to move furniture?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, we&#8217;ll be happy to move furniture. However, there may be an additional charge. Any valuable items or furniture containing valuables should be moved by the customer, or clearly brought to our attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I have a sisal, coir or natural fibres carpet. Do you clean those?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No problem &#8211; we&#8217;re happy to clean natural plant fibres carpets and rugs. We use a dry-cleaning system, so as to avoid water damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, with natural fibres, some stains just can&#8217;t be completely removed. But we&#8217;ll do our best. We&#8217;ll perform a thorough cleaning process to leave your carpet fresh, clean and healthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get in touch<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve designed this website to give you as much useful information as I can about my carpet and upholstery cleaning services.
