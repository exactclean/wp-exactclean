They have excellent water resistance but they provide only little or no protection against oily type of stains. This products having tendency to attract dry soil which can increase resoiling due to their sticky residues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second types of protectors used in textiles are fluorochemicals which are favoured protectors for carpets and upholstery. They create a barrier by lowering a surface energy. The fabric or fibres become more difficult to wet and the dry soils will not adhere. fluorochemicals protectors are better all round than silicones but they will not make carpet and upholstery completely stain proof.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Which fibers will benefit most from protection?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely all natural fibers which are not resistant to water based stains plus some synthetic fibers. Wool, nylon, silk, rayon (viscose), cotton, linen and even polyester will benefit from protection. It is not magical staff which will stop everything from soaking into the fiber but even if it will not stay on the surface and will soak straight in (urine, hot drinks) there is higher chance to remove it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two types of protectors we use, both are fluorochemicals. Water based fluorochemical protector and solvent based fluorochemical for water sensitive fibers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The main advantages of investing in carpet and upholstery protector:<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Extending&nbsp; the life of your upholstery and carpets<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easy removal of soils and spills<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Acting as a shield against oil and water based stains<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Protection against UV sun damage<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reducing wear and tear<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Vacuuming more effective by allowing dry soil to be easily extracted<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Massively improving professional cleaning results by preventing soil and spills penetrating into the fibers<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you will decide to get your carpets or fabrics protected, please contact us to receive free no obligated quote.
