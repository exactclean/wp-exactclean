Our services are available nationwide, with such a specialised service offered it is not unusual for us to travel around the UK to provide our expert support to businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Envirosafe is applied onto the area to be sanitised and disinfected with our CE approved Fogging machine. Fog allows atomised product to get everywhere and guarantee complete room decontamination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The area is back in use within 60 minutes of the treatment taking place. The above product applied correctly will kill 99.9999% of bacteria. We also offer single item disinfection; please contact us for a free no-obligation quote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been independently tested in the past against the A\/H1N1 swine flu virus amongst Mycobacterium, Tuberculosis, MRSA, Medical Waste Treatment, Feline Calicivirus (Human Norovirus surrogate), Feline Coronavirus (SARA surrogate), Enveloped and non-enveloped virus, HIV and C. difficile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Envirosafe is safe to use around humans and has no significant environmental impact.&nbsp; Because it works on a nanoscopic scale, the same level as a virus, it is simply too small to harm people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The antimicrobial effects of Envirosafe can last weeks. In high use areas where the surfaces are rubbed against and contamination is re-introduced, we advise a more realistic period of 24 hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fogging process offers a complete way to kill bacteria and viruses, as soon as it contacts with them.&nbsp; Not only that, but it also removes bacteria that lead to foul-smelling odours, something that is particularly an issue in businesses and public places.

This service is not only to ensure areas are as clean and free of contaminants as possible from day to day use but also for stand-alone issues that need addressing as a matter of urgency, such as after flooding has taken place. Decontamination after flooding is essential for the health of those who will be using the space in the future. Outbreaks of viruses that cause illness such as Coronavirus are also an excellent reason to sanitise areas without delay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Commercial customers<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Commercial premises such as care homes, rental properties, hotels, nurseries, offices, schools, public transportation (trains, buses, aircraft) can all benefit from fogging. Restaurants and kids&#8217; play areas are always at high risk of being contaminated by bacteria. Along with disease-causing microbes (pathogens, germs or bugs) which are responsible for causing infectious diseases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are the needs of specialist industries.&nbsp; One example is the healthcare industry.&nbsp; Here, methods to clean and sanitise surfaces have long been in place and have good effectiveness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is always a risk of microbial contamination that can occur, leading to infection of personnel and patients.&nbsp; The use of ATP tests after the fogging can ensure that this doesn&#8217;t happen.&nbsp; The system is even effective for surgery theatres and operating rooms, where patients are at their most vulnerable to infection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Envirosafe, passed &amp; approved to european standards<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our fogger is a large model that means we can also help with cleaning and sanitising even the largest spaces.&nbsp; In the past, we have worked on areas such as airports and cruise ships with large, open spaces.&nbsp; These can be a breeding ground for bacteria and viruses and regular cleaning at a microbial level is crucial in fighting these problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can sanitise and disinfect your premises for you regularly or as a one-off service. We will provide you with a certificate saying that the premises have been treated with Envirosafe which passed EN 14476 Virucidal Test in April 2020. This test is the requirement against COVID-19 as it covers all enveloped viruses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Domestic customers<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>For domestic customers, the demand isn&#8217;t to the scale with commercial customers, but there are still plenty of ways our service can help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you buy anything second hand, you should always consider having it sanitised.&nbsp; Kitchen appliances and storage units, bedroom furniture or even bathroom fittings can all be cleaned, even if they are new.&nbsp; That&#8217;s because items may have been sitting in storage for some time and bacteria will use any opportunity to grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are moving into a new home or want to have your house cleaned to a different level, our service will help.&nbsp; It can sanitise everything from the rooms of the house, the car or even outbuildings and allows you to rest safe with cleaning followed with ATP hygiene monitoring test.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/www.exactclean.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/sanitising-services-and-disinfection-services.jpg\" alt=\"disinfection services and sanitising services\" class=\"wp-image-2488\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.exactclean.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/sanitising-services-and-disinfection-services.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.exactclean.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/sanitising-services-and-disinfection-services-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.exactclean.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/sanitising-services-and-disinfection-services-272x182.jpg 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why fogging with Envirosafe is the best option<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of us, wiping over surfaces and using anti-bacterial sprays is a part of life and a reasonable step taken to protect against viruses and bacteria.&nbsp; But there are times when this simply isn&#8217;t enough, especially for businesses and those operating public places, healthcare facilities or education establishments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tests show that traditional wiping of surfaces only clears around 11% of bacteria and viruses, according to the British Medical Journal.&nbsp; In fact, the system can even end up spreading the germs because they attach to the cloth and then are wiped onto clean surfaces.&nbsp; Not only that, but there are many hard to reach spots that regular cleaning cannot reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disinfection services and sanitising services<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By opting for a more comprehensive system, you can ensure that the property is clean to a nanoscopic level and have the test results to prove it.&nbsp; These results are provided to you as records to show proof that you are working on dealing with this common problem most comprehensively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We offer a range of options for homes and businesses, including regular cleaning or standalone sessions depending on your needs.&nbsp; All sessions come with relevant paperwork for your records. We provide before and after certificates.
